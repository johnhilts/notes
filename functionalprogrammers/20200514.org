* Parsers (by Jason)
top down parser easier to do manually - match left with right, and work down
bottom up parser is difficult to do by hand

Parsec - the Haskell parser combinator library
ExParsec exists for elixir, but is still limited...

elixir suitable for writing a recursive descent parser with just the base language, no libs
pattern matching helps

elixir has a =defmacro= keyword?!?

in this case, using macros cleaned up the syntax versus using "pure" functions
.some_call(argument)
/versus/
.some_call(fn -> argument end) # or something like that

to do mutability in elixir you have to spawn another process - the smallest unit is an agent for doing mutability
