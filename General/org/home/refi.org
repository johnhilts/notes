** Goals
Lower monthly payment

** TODO Does refinancing make financial sense?
- [ ] Is the interest rate lower than your existing rate?
  - [ ] Existing rate
    - 3.875%
  - [ ] New Rate
    - [ ] Expected
    - [ ] Actual
- [ ] Will the new rate increase your monthly payments?
- [ ] Will you pay more money over the entire length of the loan?

*** TODO Rule of thumb
- [ ] If the current interest rate is at least a half percent lower than the interest rate in your existing mortgage, then refinancing may be a good option for you.
  - For example, if you have $390,000 remaining on an original $400,000 loan at 4.25%, replacing your current mortgage at 3.75% could save as much as $162 per month.
  - In addition to interest rates, homeowners also need to consider the length of the new loan term.
    - If you’re five years into your current mortgage and refinance into a new 30-year fixed-rate loan, you’ll be making monthly payments for a total of 35 years — which could result in paying more interest over the life of your loan.

** Type of refinancing
*** FHA Streamlining
- https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/mortgages/fha-streamline-refinance/
** Mortgage insurance
If you have private mortgage insurance (PMI), *you can easily get rid of it once your loan-to-value (LTV) ratio falls below 80%.*

** TODO Home Insurance
- [ ] Be prepared to provide a copy of your current homeowners insurance policy.
  - Hard copy ready
  - Web: couldn't find on qbe.com/us

** list of FHA lenders
- https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/mortgages/best-lenders-fha-loans/

** How much does an FHA streamline refinance cost?
- With an FHA streamline refinance, you'll pay an upfront mortgage insurance premium of 1.75% of your loan amount.
- You may be able to roll your initial mortgage insurance premium into your loan and pay it off over time.
- On top of that premium, you may be liable for other closing costs, like loan origination and recording fees that vary by lender. You won't be able to roll these other costs into your loan.

** FHA streamline guidelines (rules)
- Your streamline refinance must result in a *shorter loan term*, a lower mortgage interest rate, or both


** TODO List of online lenders

*** FHA loan: warning

*** TODO Checklist
  - [ ] Make sure to look at APR numbers, *not* APY
  - [ ] No cost refinancing - the costs get added to the loan amount - might make sense depending on time, etc
  - [X] Make sure there's no pre-payment penalty
  - [ ] Calculating break-even
    - Example, closing costs = $6,000 and saving $100/month, divide $6,000 by $100 => 60.  It will take 60 months (five years) before break even.

**** Notes
***** PMI
 - If you pay < 20%, then you'll have to get PMI
   - 20% of home's value, or 20% of the loan?
***** debt-to-income ratio
- Divide the total of all your monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income
  - Should be 43% or less
***** Break even
- To figure out when you'll break even, divide the closing costs by how much lower your monthly payment will be. (see example above)

** Notes
*** TODO Step 1: Gather basic information you’ll need to start getting quotes
- [ ] Current mortgage statement
- [ ] Date you took out current mortgage
  - Mainly concerned if you've had > 7 months
- [ ] Estimated FICO Score
  - your credit score
    - March 8, 2021
      - Transunion: 762
      - Equifax: 768
- [X] How much your house is worth
  - Zillow's zestimate: $365K
  - Trulia: $365K
  - if appraisal is low, rate and costs could go *up*
- [ ] Get all the quotes on the same day
  - credit inquiries by multiple lenders only count as 1 credit pull if done on the same day
- [ ] Take your best quotes to your current lender to see if they’ll negotiate
  - Current lender may give you:
    - waiving appraisal inspection
    - allow you to roll over the balance of your escrow account
      - Notes on escrow account (I have one, according to this)
	- If your current payment includes a portion for your property taxes and insurance, then you have an escrow account.
	- An escrow account is simply a savings account the lender creates to pay your property taxes and insurance when they come due
	- Is required on loans if you have *less than 20% equity in your home*
	- If you refinance with a lender besides your current lender, you’ll have to set up a new escrow account
	  - That means extra money out of your pocket at closing.
	  - However, you do end up getting a refund of whatever is in your current lender’s escrow account
	    - so *you often get most if not all of the funds you spend on the new account back*.
