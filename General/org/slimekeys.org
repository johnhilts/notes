* Format Code
** =Tab= at the beginning of each line will format it.
** re-indent a whole expression with the point on the opening =(= then =C-M-q=
** re-indent the whole body of a function from anywhere within it with =C-c M-q=
** close all parens in sexp =C-c C-]=

* Build code

** Compile =C-c C-c= runs the command slime-compile-defun, which in turn sends the definition to Lisp to be evaluated and compiled. 
- =(load(compile-file("c:/path/to/file")))= compiles and loads into current buffer
- =C-c C-l= is the shortcut for load and compile-file

* UI
- M-x invert-face<ret>default<ret> ; toggle light/dark mode
- (set-cursor-color "#ffffff") ; make the cursor visible

- clear buffer (useful if you have very large output in the repl)
=C-c M-o=

- stop running process
=C-c C-b=
*remember* hit C-b twice if inside temux!
