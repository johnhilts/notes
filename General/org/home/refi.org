** Goals
Lower monthly payment

** Does refinancing make financial sense?
- [ ] Is the interest rate lower than your existing rate?
- [ ] Will the new rate increase your monthly payments?
- [ ] Will you pay more money over the entire length of the loan?

*** Rule of thumb
- [ ] If the current interest rate is at least a half percent lower than the interest rate in your existing mortgage, then refinancing may be a good option for you.
  - For example, if you have $390,000 remaining on an original $400,000 loan at 4.25%, replacing your current mortgage at 3.75% could save as much as $162 per month.
  - In addition to interest rates, homeowners also need to consider the length of the new loan term.
    - If you’re five years into your current mortgage and refinance into a new 30-year fixed-rate loan, you’ll be making monthly payments for a total of 35 years — which could result in paying more interest over the life of your loan.
