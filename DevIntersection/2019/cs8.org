@ C#8 what's new?

** Kathleen Dollard (very good speaker, easily best so far)

/static in a nested method prevents closing??/
  need to test ...
  
*C#8 only runs on .net core*
- only partially true
- but which feaures work/don't work complicated
  
* nullable reference types
  - in =csproj= add =<Nullable>true</Nullable>=
  /this will change the default re: nullability/
  - do it more selectively in code =#nullable enable=
  - When the default's changed to not nullable, add =?= to add an exception: /this type is allowed to be nullable/
  - None of this excuses you from null checking, though
  - =!= is the /null forgiving operator/ but considered a code smell ... aka /dammit, do what I said/ operator ...
  - There's a =!= attribute too? (or did they say annotation?)

* Asynchronous streams
  - watch the ignite video ...
  
* Default interface members
- very limited!
- can only be used in C#8 in .net core 3.0
- nothing else can use/consume it!!  

* Index / Range
- =var x = arr[..]; // get the entire array - useful with multi-diminsional arrays=

* Switch Expressions
  - need default or =_= when switching on enums
  /because you can put something not defined in the enums in a variable of enum type!!/
  - =_= works similarly to F# (pattern matching)
  - you can *not* =or= the conditions (unlike F#), and it *might* show up in C#9
