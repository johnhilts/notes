* haskell question
** How to output sound
you can use CreateEventA like with C

* Property based testing
** ExUnit
Similar to specify/describe style
string data
doctest example from code wars
send a bunch of values to all be tested (compared)

some syntax such as pipeline looks like ML

in Elixir, it looks like =Enum= is short "enumeration" and has helper methods like =.join=

#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
words <- blah(function())
words
|> split(' ')
|> blah(bar)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
foo
|> bar
#+END_SRC

example of pattern matching in this week's code (and probably other weeks')

* Next meeting 3/5

TDD kata with nix
another property based testing kata

* Favorite unit testing f/w?
hspec
not that different from hUnit
