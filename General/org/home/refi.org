** Goals
Lower monthly payment

** Does refinancing make financial sense?
- [ ] Is the interest rate lower than your existing rate?
- [ ] Will the new rate increase your monthly payments?
- [ ] Will you pay more money over the entire length of the loan?

*** Rule of thumb
- [ ] If the current interest rate is at least a half percent lower than the interest rate in your existing mortgage, then refinancing may be a good option for you.
  - For example, if you have $390,000 remaining on an original $400,000 loan at 4.25%, replacing your current mortgage at 3.75% could save as much as $162 per month.
  - In addition to interest rates, homeowners also need to consider the length of the new loan term.
    - If you’re five years into your current mortgage and refinance into a new 30-year fixed-rate loan, you’ll be making monthly payments for a total of 35 years — which could result in paying more interest over the life of your loan.

  - [ ] Make sure to look at APR numbers, *not* APY
  - [ ] No cost refinancing - the costs get added to the loan amount - might make sense depending on time, etc
  - [ ] Make sure there's no pre-payment penalty
  - [ ] Calculating break-even
    - Example, closing costs = $6,000 and saving $100/month, divide $6,000 by $100 => 60.  It will take 60 months (five years) before break even.

**** Notes
***** PMI
 - If you pay < 20%, then you'll have to get PMI
   - 20% of home's value, or 20% of the loan?
***** debt-to-income ratio
- Divide the total of all your monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income
  - Should be 43% or less
***** Break even
- To figure out when you'll break even, divide the closing costs by how much lower your monthly payment will be. (see example above)
