* A-List / Association List
** What is it?
- A list of dotted pairs.
  - =assoc= treats the =car= as the key to the =cdr=
  - =rassoc= treats the =cdr= as the key to the =car=
** Literal format
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
'(a . b) ; one "association"?
(cons 'a 'b) ; same as above, using CONS
#+END_SRC
** Associate functions (no pun intended)
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(assoc 'c '((a . b) (c . d) (e . f))) ; (C . D)
(rassoc 'd '((a . b) (c . d) (e . f))) ; (C . D)

;; pairlis takes two lists and makes an association list that
;; associates elements of the 1st list to corresponding elements of the 2nd list
(pairlis '(one two) '(1 2) '((three . 3) (four . 19)))
;; => ((one . 1) (two . 2) (three . 3) (four . 19))

** Other notes
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
;; the following 2 are similar ...
(assoc item list :test fn)
(find item list :test fn :key #'car)
;; except that ... if nil appears in the a-list in place of a pair, and the item being searched for is nil, 
;; find will blithely compute the car of the nil in the a-list, find that it is equal to the item,
;; and return nil, whereas assoc will ignore the nil in the a-list and continue to search for 
;; an actual pair (cons) whose car is nil. See find and position.

*** To "update" a list just insert a pair with the same key

(let ((a-list (list '(1 . one) '(2 . two) '(3 . three))))

;; (2 . DOS)

** Something I noticed (WATCH OUT!!)
Even if the associations aren't dotted pairs, assoc still "works":
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(assoc 1 (list '(1 one))) ; (1 ONE)
;; but ...
(rassoc 'one (list '(1 one))) ; nil
;; because ...
(cdr (assoc 1 (list '(1 one)))) ; (ONE) - gasp!!
